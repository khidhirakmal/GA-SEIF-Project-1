# GA-SEIF-Project-1

Hello, this is my first game build. It is a simple 2D racing game where the player controls a car that races down a road while avoiding traffic. 

(Objective)
The main goal is to cover as much distance as possible while avoiding collision with the traffic. The player controls the black car while the traffic to avoid
are the cars in red.

(Controls)
Up Arrow -  Throttle
Down Arrow - Reverse
Left Arrow - Steer Left
Right Arrow - Steer Right
